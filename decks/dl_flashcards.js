    "q": "What is the purpose of activation functions in neural networks?",
    "a": "They introduce non-linearities, enabling networks to model complex functions. Examples include Sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU."
  },
  {
    "q": "How does a multilayer perceptron (MLP) learn?",
    "a": "It uses a feed-forward architecture and learns weights through backpropagation and gradient descent using a loss function like cross-entropy."
  },
  {
    "q": "What architecture is commonly used for image classification tasks?",
    "a": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which use convolutional and pooling layers to learn spatial hierarchies."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the main benefit of using convolution in CNNs?",
    "a": "Parameter sharing reduces the number of parameters while capturing local spatial patterns."
  },
  {
    "q": "What architecture is suitable for text generation?",
    "a": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which process sequences using hidden states that evolve over time."
  },
  {
    "q": "How does a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) differ from a regular autoencoder?",
    "a": "A VAE learns a latent distribution (typically Gaussian) and samples from it, allowing generative capabilities."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do GANs generate data?",
    "a": "GANs use a generator-discriminator setup where the generator creates data and the discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the loss function used for classification in neural networks?",
    "a": "Cross-entropy loss is commonly used for classification tasks."
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the key components of the Transformer model?",
    "a": "Attention mechanism, positional encoding, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and skip connections."
  },
  {
    "q": "What architecture is used in U-Nets and for what purpose?",
    "a": "U-Nets use an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections and are popular for image segmentation and translation tasks."
  },
  {
    "q": "What model architecture is used in modern diffusion models?",
    "a": "U-Net is commonly used to learn to denoise images in reverse steps."
  },
  {
    "q": "What kind of data are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) good for?",
    "a": "They are suitable for graph-structured data such as molecules, 3D meshes, and citation networks."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the idea behind deep generative models?",
    "a": "They use deep neural networks to learn data distributions and generate new samples (e.g., VAEs, GANs)."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do autoregressive models like PixelRNN work?",
    "a": "They decompose joint distributions into conditionals and model each step sequentially."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the principle behind score-based models?",
    "a": "They work with score functions (gradients of log probability) instead of directly computing the likelihood."
